# LeetCode Practice
This repository is my space to learn and develop my algorithmic and data structure skills. In this repo, I will focus on:

## Purpose
- clean and maintanable code executions
- test-driven learning, implementing test cases for problems I work on using pytest
- re-usable structures, such as a ListNode class for common problems
- experimenting different approaches
- understanding code impact on space and time complexity
- each problem will have its own small README
